Snapdragon™ Game Super Resolution 2 (Snapdragon™ GSR 2 or just SGSR 2) was developed by Qualcomm Snapdragon™ Game Studios; 
it's our temporal upscaling solution optimized for Adreno GPUs.

Snapdragon™ GSR 2 strikes a better balance between performance and visual quality on mobile devices than other temporal upscaling methods. 
Its main goal is to improve the quality of the final image by reducing aliasing, flicker, and ghosting while increasing image resolution.
